Ansible remediation role for profile C2S  
Profile Title:  C2S for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  
Profile Description:  
This profile demonstrates compliance against the  
U.S. Government Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) baseline.  
  
This baseline was inspired by the Center for Internet Security  
(CIS) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Benchmark, v2.1.1 - 01-31-2017.  
  
For the SCAP Security Guide project to remain in compliance with  
CIS' terms and conditions, specifically Restrictions(8), note  
there is no representation or claim that the C2S profile will  
ensure a system is in compliance or consistency with the CIS  
baseline.  
  
Benchmark ID:  RHEL-7  

XCCDF Version:  1.1  
  
This file was generated by OpenSCAP 1.2.17 using:  
    $ oscap xccdf generate fix --profile C2S --template urn:xccdf:fix:script:ansible xccdf-file.xml   
  
This script is generated from an OpenSCAP profile without preliminary evaluation.  
It attempts to fix every selected rule, even if the system is already compliant.

$ ansible-playbook -i "192.168.1.155," playbook.yml
